"""Module that contains the command line app.

Why does this file exist, and why not put this in __main__?

You might be tempted to import things from __main__ later, but that will cause
problems: the code will get executed twice:

    - When you run `python -mmdtab` python will execute
      ``__main__.py`` as a script. That means there won't be any
      ``mdta.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
    - When you import __main__ it will get executed again (as a module) because
      there's no ``mdta.__main__`` in ``sys.modules``.
